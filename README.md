[Vostok](http://vostok.tools) provides instrumentation for microservices and a number of Vostok infrastructure components. Instrumentation is required to collect data which is necessary for any production-ready distributed system:

* logs for application lifecycle
* metrics for resource usage
* traces for intra-cluster interaction
