[Vostok](http://vostok.tools) provides tools for microservices and a number of Vostok infrastructure components. Tools are required to collect data, which is necessary for any production-ready distributed system:

* logs for application lifecycle
* metrics for resource usage
* traces for intra-cluster interaction

## Vostok.Logging

Vostok.Logging is a set of libraries.  
  
If you use Vostok for logging only, you get major profit in perfomance.  
Similar messages in console are written at speed ~ 23 000 mes/sec  
different ~ 8 500 â€“ 16 000 mes/sec

But Vostok is not just one library, it's a toolbox. If you use several Vostok libraries, your profit is in good integration. No worries about compatibility and other libraries.

### Features:

* Structured logging
* Fully asynchronous
* Flexible setting
* Fast work 
* [Integration with Serilog and Log4Net](integration-with-serilog-log4net/)
